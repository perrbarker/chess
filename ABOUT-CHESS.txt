My chess program was made in my first computer science class. I was
responsible for designing the algorithms for the chess pieces. I worked
with my partner Dalton on designing pseudocode that he was able to understand
easily translate to the program. If we continued to work on the game after
the class ended, we could have cleaned up the display of the board state
to make the game look complete.
